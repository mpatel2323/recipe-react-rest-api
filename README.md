Description: A React web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients and view detailed information about each recipe.

Technologies Used: React.js , RESTful API for recipe data , HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling) , JavaScript (ES6+)

Features:
1. Search Recipes: Users can search for recipes by entering ingredients.
2. Display Results: Display a list of recipes based on the user's search query.
3. View Recipe Details: Users can click on a recipe to view detailed information such as ingredients, instructions, and cooking time.

This work sample demonstrates my ability to work with React, utilize REST API, and deliver a polished web application ready for deployment.
